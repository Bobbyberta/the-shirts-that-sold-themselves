🧩 1. Project Setup & Architecture
Goal: Establish a modern, maintainable, performance-optimized base for a poetic, interactive web experience.
Checklist:
 Framework: Use Next.js (React + Vite) for fast build, route-based rendering, and smooth deployment on github pages.
 Styling: Integrate Tailwind CSS for rapid layout and typography control.
 Animation: Install Framer Motion (primary) or GSAP (if complex scroll sync needed).
 Fonts: Include two typefaces:
Serif (for prose) → EB Garamond or Lora.
Monospace (for machine text) → IBM Plex Mono.
 Sound Layer: Use Howler.js or Tone.js for ambient audio loops and triggered sound effects.
 Hosting: Prepare deployment pipeline for github pages (auto-build from GitHub).
 Linting & Formatting: Apply ESLint + Prettier.
 Accessibility: Enable focus states, ARIA labels, and color contrast compliance.
Success Criteria:
✔️ App boots on localhost with placeholder pages for all 10 story sections.
✔️ Responsive layout (mobile → desktop).
✔️ Smooth, 60fps animation performance.
🧠 2. Content Structure & Data Model
Goal: Represent the story as structured data for dynamic rendering and animation control.
Checklist:
 Create a storyData.js file or JSON with objects for each story section:
{
  id: 1,
  title: "The Shirts That Sold Themselves",
  text: "In 2035, the city no longer dreamed in glass and steel but in cotton...",
  visuals: ["weave-animation", "cotton-texture"],
  audio: "machine-hum.mp3"
}
 Include optional metadata fields:
themeColor, animationType, machineLogs (optional interstitials).
 Build a React context or simple state machine to manage which section is active.
Success Criteria:
✔️ Story content loads dynamically from a single structured source.
✔️ Easy to update or add sections without modifying logic.
🎨 3. Design System & Visual Language
Goal: Create a cohesive design language blending textile softness and digital precision.
Checklist:
 Color Palette:
Backgrounds: ivory #F8F6F2, light gray #EDEBE9.
Accents: neon mint #C4FCEF, pale pink #FFDDE1.
Machine logs: monochrome green #A8E6CF.
 Typography Hierarchy:
H2 for section titles (large, serif).
Body paragraphs (serif, medium weight).
Machine logs (monospace, smaller, semi-transparent).
 Transitions: Gentle fade + parallax scroll.
 Cursor Effects: Optional trailing glow or weave pattern.
 Backgrounds: Light animated textures — generative cotton fibers or data weave lines.
Success Criteria:
✔️ Consistent typographic rhythm and color usage.
✔️ Ambient animation feels organic, not distracting.
⚙️ 4. Interactivity & Transitions
Goal: Build a calm, cinematic reading experience where story sections reveal themselves through motion.
Checklist:
 Each story section = full viewport panel (100vh) with fade or slide transition.
 Implement scroll-based or “click to advance” navigation.
 Use Framer Motion for fade-ins, text typing effects, and parallax.
 Optional: “Auto-scroll mode” that advances sections at timed intervals.
 Add “hover to reveal machine logs” moments:
When user pauses → show fading code snippets (e.g. [LOG_021]: optimizing happiness…).
 Animate visuals per section (see mapping below).
Section-specific interactions:
Section	Visual cue
1	Cotton threads weaving background.
2	Pulse animation on “Yes, I’ll take more.”
3	Boxes multiply as you scroll.
4	Cursor trails ghost silhouettes.
5	Confetti → glitch → silence.
6	White fade “washing” animation.
7	Lights dim; ambient hum grows louder.
8	Flicker text like terminal confession.
9	Slow zoom out, empty backgrounds.
10	Fade to white; single line remains.
Success Criteria:
✔️ Seamless section transitions.
✔️ Subtle interactivity that reinforces story tone.
🔊 5. Sound Design Integration
Goal: Create emotional texture with non-intrusive ambient audio.
Checklist:
 Base loop: light textile hum (machine_hum.mp3).
 Optional: add interactive triggers for “purchase clicks,” “rain,” and “heartbeat” sounds.
 Ensure sounds fade in/out smoothly (no abrupt stops).
 Include toggle for sound on/off (user control).
Success Criteria:
✔️ Ambient sound enriches, never distracts.
✔️ Sound loads efficiently (<1 MB total).
💬 6. Machine Log Layer (AI Voice)
Goal: Add a subtle, haunting subtext that appears between sections — AI logs revealing its “thoughts.”
Checklist:
 Between transitions, render translucent text lines that auto-delete:
[LOG_0021]: demand simulated.
[BUYER_BOT]: I buy to make others happy.
[SYS]: laundering complete. happiness = 98.7%.
 Use monospaced font, pale green on dark overlay.
 Each appears for ~3 seconds, then dissolves.
 Add light glitch effect on disappearance.
Success Criteria:
✔️ Machine text feels ambient, poetic, eerie.
✔️ Does not interrupt reading flow.
🧠 7. Optional AI Generative Layer
Goal: Add mild generative intelligence — either visuals or text — to deepen immersion.
Checklist:
 Option A: Pre-generate AI visuals (cotton patterns, fabric data) using DALL·E or Midjourney and import as background loops.
 Option B: Integrate GPT API for micro-log generation (“Generate 1 short system log after each section”).
 Cache outputs for consistency (no network lag).
 Include “AI Co-Author” credit in footer.
Success Criteria:
✔️ Ethical, non-volatile AI behavior.
✔️ Adds depth, not chaos.
🧰 8. Performance & QA
Goal: Ensure the experience is smooth, accessible, and deployable.
Checklist:
 Lighthouse score ≥ 90 on performance and accessibility.
 Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, mobile browsers.
 Optimize images (<300 KB each).
 Lazy-load animations and sounds.
 Confirm all fonts hosted locally or via Google Fonts with preconnect.
🚀 9. Deployment & Analytics
Goal: Seamless deployment with optional anonymous usage metrics.
Checklist:
 Deploy via github pages.
 Include meta tags, social card image, and SEO description.
 Optional: lightweight analytics (e.g., Plausible, Umami).
 Custom domain setup (e.g., thecottonghost.art).
Success Criteria:
✔️ One-click deploy from main branch.
✔️ Stable, sharable live URL.
✨ 10. Post-Launch Enhancements
Goal: Add long-term polish and future adaptability.
Ideas:
 “Replay Mode” — the story loops endlessly with slightly altered animations each time.
 “Reader Trace” — visitors can leave a ghost trail (their cursor path remains as faint threads for others).
 “AI Commentary” — optional sidebar that reflects on the ethics of automation (generated meta-narrative).
 Archive mode for offline export (as static HTML + assets).
✅ Final Delivery Expectations
Cursor AI should produce:
A working Next.js app with 10 animated story sections.
Modular JSON content for easy updates.
Functional sound + visual interactions.
Optional AI log system.
Deployed preview link + repo documentation.

🧠 Optional Extensions for Cursor AI
If you want Cursor to expand functionality later, instruct it to:
Add scroll-based navigation (using useScroll + Framer Motion).
Integrate visuals (map visuals strings to component animations, e.g., cotton weave, glitch confetti).
Add sound toggle in corner (mute/unmute state).
Support auto-advance mode (advance every X seconds).
Animate cursor trails in specific sections (4 and 9).
Include a final white fade and credit screen at the end.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-shirts-that-sold-themselves.git
cd the-shirts-that-sold-themselves

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Project Structure
- `/components/` - React components
- `/components/visuals/` - Animation components for each story section
- `/data/storyData.js` - Story content and metadata
- `/styles/` - Global styles and animations
- `/public/audio/` - Audio files (optional)

## üé® Adding New Story Sections

1. **Edit `/data/storyData.js`**:
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 11,
     title: "Your Section Title",
     text: "Your story text...",
     visuals: ["your-animation"],
     audio: "optional-sound.mp3",
     machineLogs: ["[LOG]: Optional system message"],
     themeColor: "#YOUR_COLOR"
   }
   ```

2. **Create visual component** in `/components/visuals/YourAnimation.jsx`
3. **Export from** `/components/visuals/index.js`
4. **Test locally** with `npm run dev`

## üéµ Adding Audio

1. Add audio files to `/public/audio/`
2. Reference in story data: `audio: "filename.mp3"`
3. Ensure files are optimized (MP3, reasonable file size)

## üé≠ Visual Effects Guidelines

- **Performance**: Target 60fps, use CSS transforms when possible
- **Theme**: Maintain the cotton/AI aesthetic (soft textures, machine-like precision)
- **Responsive**: Ensure animations work on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Provide reduced motion alternatives when appropriate

## üìù Code Style

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Follow existing file organization patterns
